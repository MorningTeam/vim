scroll:
    Ctrl_b [

Ctrl-b then [ then you can use your normal navigation keys to scroll around (eg. Up Arrow or PgDn). Press q to quit scroll mode.

Alternatively you can press Ctrl-b PgUp to go directly into copy mode and scroll one page up (which is what it sounds like you will want most of the time)

You can also scroll up/down line by line using Shift-k and Shift-j (if you're already in scroll mode)
